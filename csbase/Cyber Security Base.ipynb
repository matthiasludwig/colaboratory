    "- **Threat:** Is the intention to cause damage. For cyber security this can be defined as a hostile act aimed by an attacker at an asset. Regardless of the attacker's intent to do no harm, a threat is still a threat. The attacker posing a threat is commonly called a threat actor.\n",
    "- **Vulnerability:** Is a defect in a target system. This defect may be a bug in application code, or a flaw in the design of the system. A vulnerabilities can also be a consequence of improper configuration or user action.\n",
    "- **Exploit:** Is a way to take advantage of a known vulnerability. The usual objective is to take control over the asset. (Social engineering, commonly considered a simple scam, is one kind of exploit.)"

    "\n",
    "[The Oxford document](https://www.oxfordeconomics.com/my-oxford/projects/276032) distinguishes between two kinds of costs that are relevant when a cyber security attack takes place:\n",
    "1. Direct Costs associated with the attack:\n",
    "- Clean-up or Remediation costs associated with an attack.\n",
    "- Lost productivity due to the disruption of the normal operation of the business\n",
    "- Damage to the IT equipment (physically; either theft or destruction)\n",
    "- Damage through the loss of Intellectual Property.\n",
    "- Loss of competitive position due to the release of internal documents (i.e. take-over plans)\n",
    "2. Indirect Costs associated with an attack:\n",
    "Here the report talks about the costs incurred due to the loss of the brand's value. If a company publishes that it was the target of an attack, different stakeholders (such as customers) lose faith in the company and the valuation of the company can suffer. The report measured this costs as the loss of the stock-price after publication of a security incident.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally on pages 54ff. the Oxford report also looks at the macro environment of costs that are relevant when talking about cybersecurity:\n",
    "1. Costs associated with the anticipation of the crime.\n",
    "Meaning the purchasing of IT equipment, knowledge etc. to prevent a security incident in the first place.\n",
    "2. Costs associated as the consequence of a cyber attack\n",
    "The above mentioned direct and indirect costs are relevant here.\n",
    "3. Costs deriving from the response to a cyber crime\n",
    "Here the report talks about the justice system and it's actors to pursue an attacker. This costs is incurred by the tax payer."
