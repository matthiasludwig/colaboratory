## week1

### Introduction

#### Definitions
* **Vulnerability** - Is a weakness, a flaw in a program, device, system even a person.
* **MICE (FBI Definition)** - Money, Ideology, Compromise/Coercion, Ego/Exportation
* **MEECES** - Money, Ego, Entertainment, Cause, Entrance, Status

#### Cybersecurity Threats
* Ransomware
* Integrity attacks

## week2

### The CIA Model

* Confidentiality - Achieved mainly through Cryptography
* Integrity - Achieved mainly through Hashing
* Accessibility - Achieved mainly through Load balancing/Ddos Protection

### The AAA Model

#### Authentication

Authentication requires proof of:
* Something you know (i.e. Password)
* Something you have (i.e. Keycard)
* Something you are (i.e. Biometry)

Combination of more than one of the authentication categories is called MFA - Multi-Factor-Authentication.

#### Authorization

Based on the user's credentials the user has certain rights. Principle of least privilege (enough privileges to do certain functions. not more)

#### Accounting

Keeping track of user's and their actions (Forensics).
Possibility to track individual actions instead of generic ones.

### Threat Agents

A **threat agent - or threat actor** - is anything that can possibly damage or disrupt the system's ability to perform as it needs to.

The goal is to secure **Assets** (Hardware, Software, IP, People, etc.)

**Exploit** - use a vulnerability to gain access/control and penetrate an asset.

**Risk** - is defined as Probability x Impact

**Mitigation** - has the goal to reduce the Risk (by reducing the Probability or Impact)
