# AWS Management

## Cloud Trail

Cloud Trail allows you to audit (or review) everything that occurs in your AWS account. Cloud Trail does this by recording all the AWS API calls occurring in your account and delivering a log file to you.

## Cloud Watch

Cloud Watch is a service that monitors resources and applications that run on AWS by collecting data in the form of logs, metrics, and events.

## IaC - Infrastructure as Code

Infrastructure as Code allows you to describe and provision all the infrastructure resources in your cloud environment. You can stand up servers, databases, runtime parameters, resources, etc. based on scripts that you write. Infrastructure as Code is a time-saving feature because it allows you to provision (or stand up) resources in a reproducible way.

CloudFormation let's you write your infrastructure as a text file. It can be written in JSON or yaml.
It also offers a visual designer and the document can be checked in to Version Control.
