# Messaging & Containers

## Messaging

SNS - Simple Notification Service

Amazon Simple Notification Service (or SNS) is a cloud service that allows you to send notifications to the users of your applications. SNS allows you to decouple the notification logic from being embedded in your applications and allows notifications to be published to a large number of subscribers.

SQS - Simple Queu Service

Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fully managed message queuing service that allows you to integrate queuing functionality in your application. SQS offers two types of message queues: standard and FIFO.

## Containers

Enterprises are adopting container technology at an explosive rate. A container consists of everything an application needs to run: the application itself and its dependencies (e.g. libraries, utilities, configuration files), all bundled into one package.

Each container is an independent component that can run on its own and be moved from environment to environment.
